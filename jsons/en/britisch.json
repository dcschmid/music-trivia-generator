This connection is significant as it foreshadows Bowie's exploration of alter egos, particularly Ziggy Stardust, which would emerge in subsequent works. The album, released in 1971, marks a pivotal moment in Bowie's career, as he began to embrace avant-garde themes and theatricality in his music. Notably, 'The Man Who Sold the World' was also the title track of his earlier album released in 1970, highlighting the continuity of ideas in Bowie's songwriting. Through this character, Bowie addresses deep philosophical questions about self and persona, making it a crucial element in understanding the thematic depth of 'Hunky Dory.'"

          "trivia": "The Beatles' song 'I Am the Walrus', featured on their 1967 album 'Magical Mystery Tour', references Lewis Carroll's 'Through the Looking-Glass'. This connection is evident in the song's nonsensical and dreamlike lyrics, which echo the whimsical and surreal qualities found in Carroll's work. Additionally, John Lennon was inspired by the idea of creating a song that could be interpreted in multiple ways, much like the layered meanings present in literary texts. The song exemplifies the band's experimental approach during this period, which also included the fusion of various musical styles. 'Magical Mystery Tour' itself was a project that blurred the lines between music and visual art, further reflecting the cultural shifts of the 1960s."
